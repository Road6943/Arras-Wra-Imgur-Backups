,What's this? It's a Retired Rule!,It's still relevant should the scores be submitted but it does not need to be on the rules page,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,Cruiser-Branch,"Any cruiser-branch submissions for FFA and 4TDM Domination will not be accepted if they were done during the period when cruisers were ridiculously OP, which approximately lasted from 12:01 AM EST to 6:00 PM EST on May 8th,2018.

The following known screenshots should not be accepted if submitted as they violate the rule:
- 2.11 mil Carrier 4TDM Dom. by Road (https://bit.ly/2IuIAtA)
- 1.46 mil Carrier FFA by Efrost/EternalFrost (https://bit.ly/2K8sT8R)
- 1.08 mil Battleship FFA by trtl/Turtle (https://bit.ly/2jL1mPn)
- 1.28 mil Carrier FFA by Oganesson118 (https://bit.ly/2wu9SLR)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,This one isn't relevant at all but there's alot of text so im copying it over here in case parts want to be canabalized,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,Name used in spreadsheet,"Records will be submitted with the name you used in-game for the record. If you want the record to be submitted with your Discord name, you must provide additional screenshots for proof. Three unique screenshots total are required for gamemodes with team bases (2TDM, 4TDM, 4 Team Domination, 2 Team Domination), and two screenshots are required for gamemodes without bases (Open TDM, FFA, Mothership). Occasionally, there are ExCeptions made if you alone have shown consistent use of a certain name - examples of this include Dooky (DukeOnkled), Candy! (rtrt), Fineagle (PokeSvorlds), MQ (๓๑), etc... Additionally, please note that consistent use of a certain screen appearance can allow for exemptions from the multiple screenshot rule as well. An example of this is Zane's screen appearance (https://bit.ly/2LLwM4V) which includes the brownish bars at the top and bottom as well as the more "squarish" than normal dimensions of the screenshot itself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10,No Upgrading Mid-Game,"You cannot play as one tank for a large portion of your game, and then upgrade to a different tank mid-game, and proceed to submit a record for any of the tanks you played. For instance, you cannot play as an Overseer for a sizeable amount of time, and then upgrade to Banshee, and afterwards proceed to submit a record for either Overseer or Banshee.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
